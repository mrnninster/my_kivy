# TAKING A KIVY TUTORIAL

This is a tutorial available on youtube on the "tech with tim" here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMHK6NDVlCM&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kSJVMyYeOQ8CXJ3z1k7gHn) to the playlist.

This repo will not be in order of what has been done it will just contain files i feel should be push.

To get Started you need python installed, I am using miniconda so it reduces a tonne of stress, however there are ways to install python, do use youtube as your guide but it can sometimes be a real pain.

Next I would advice you create a seperate enviroment.

If you do create a seperate environment install kivy in it. You can find methods ofinstalling kivy for you respective platforms [here](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html)

Once thats done you are good to go.
